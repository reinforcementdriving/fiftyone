class DatasetView(foc.SampleCollection):
    """A view into a :class:`fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset`.

    Dataset views represent ordered collections of subsets of samples in a
    dataset.

    Operations on dataset views are designed to be chained together to yield
    the desired subset of the dataset, which is then iterated over to directly
    access the sample views. Each stage in the pipeline defining a dataset view
    is represented by a :class:`fiftyone.core.stages.ViewStage` instance.

    The stages of a dataset view specify:

    -   what subset of samples (and their order) should be included
    -   what "parts" (fields and their elements) of the sample should be
        included

    Samples retrieved from dataset views are returns as
    :class:`fiftyone.core.sample.SampleView` objects, as opposed to
    :class:`fiftyone.core.sample.Sample` objects, since they may contain a
    subset of the sample's content.

    See https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/using_views.html for an
    overview of working with dataset views.
